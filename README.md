# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

For this project we learned how to use MongoDB and mongoose to create a database. We learned how to create models through schemas in MongoDB as well as including a schema that is not a model in the field of another schema. We learned how to reference the ID of a separate model to populate the response we get back on queries. We used virtuals to show data in its own field without affecting the original schema of a model. For example we can get the information for all the users we have saved in the database, but also populate the response with the thoughts that are connected with that user.

## Installation

Right click the 'package.json' file and click 'Open in Integrated Terminal' then type the following in your terminal to install the neccessary packages:
```
npm i
```
You will also need to install Insomnia or similar program to act as a front-end since this application does not have front-end with it. 

MongoDB is also required as that is the database that we will be using to run this application.

## Usage

Right click the 'server.js' file and click 'Open in integrated terminal
```
npm start
```
